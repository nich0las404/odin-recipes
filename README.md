<!-- 30 June 2024 -->
So far i have started my coding journey for almost 7 months now, started
late December 2023 and have been growing since. i am currently doing this recipe project
to better my understanding of using Git and not precisely the current Recipe book itself.
I hope i can grow my understanding from following this course and strengthen my knowledge so
i can get a job in the near future.
